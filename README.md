Various analysis tools for magnetics research

## FMR data fitting
`FMRdatafitting.m` and `PolarAngleFitting.m` are used for fitting the Lorentzian derivative from ferromagnetic resonance measurements.

## PSV
`PSVanalysis.m` is used for cleaning up and analyzing time domain data from the photo-spin-voltaic effect.
